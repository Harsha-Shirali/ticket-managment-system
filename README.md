The screens should render on desktop as well as on iPad without any design breaks. 
The system should be a dashboard where both event creation and bookings can be done.
The candidate is free to improvise on the screen to increase the usability or scalability of the system. 
Data should be fetched from the service layer which should be written in Laravel. 
The data should be stored in MySQL. 
The system should have REST API using Laravel with security implementation.
UI should be done in any of the frontend frameworks [VueJS, ReactJS, or Angular]. Preferably VueJS but react or angular is not going to affect the valuation process
